I created an application in C# for the first time.  
Please take this code with a grain of salt.  
Next, I plan to make an improved calculator.  
In the future, I would like to be able to do calculations like 5 = 2 + x.  
I'll make it so that it can calculate sin cos tan, root calculations, powers, and parentheses first.  

The exe file can be found here
